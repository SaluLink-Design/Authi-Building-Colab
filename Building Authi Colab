        "*   A function `match_keywords_to_icd10` was developed to match extracted keywords against the 'ICD10 Description' column in the dataset, suggesting potential ICD-10 and PMB codes and handling case-insensitivity and duplicate matches.\n",

        "*   A function `prompt_for_documentation` was added to inform the user about the required supporting documentation for a confirmed PMB code.\n",
        "*   All implemented functions were successfully integrated into a single `authi_workflow` function, simulating the end-to-end process with user interaction via input prompts.\n",
        "*   Testing with a sample clinical note demonstrated that the integrated workflow functions as intended, successfully extracting keywords, suggesting codes, retrieving treatments, and prompting for documentation.\n",
